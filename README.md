# Bytecode-Deserializer-Execution

Some execution method I have developed, not really but still.

This is the limited source, so not everything is in here. Just some parts :)

ONLY FOR LEARNING, YOU CAN'T RELEASE THIS ANYWHERE (DISCORD, v3rm) ANYWHERE!

# Currently half-way finished.

Note: I did not make a "serializer", or "luau compiler", that means you must execute your **own** bytecode *luau*, please do not fill up my *dms* or friend *requests* because you have trouble grabbing luau, you can use FiOne or luau compiler or anything. But I do not create the luau bytecode, thank you for ***understanding***
